# Huygens Deconvolution

This tutorial will take you through the basic steps of using the Huygens Deconvolution Wizard on the Linux Workstation in the RLEM (Scwitalla Room M102).

## Login at the RLEM Workstation
User: scopeuser
Password:  please ask a staff member

## Accessing files on the FTP Server

Files are stored on the FTP server for 7 days after upload.  Otherwise you will need to request that files be re-imported from AWS for use. 

You can login by opening the link on the left hand side of the file manager window (to access open "scopeuser" folder on the desktop) called. "FTP Server".

## Open Huygens Professional

Open SVI Huygens Professional by using the link on the Desktop. 

The software will open to fill the screen and in the left center you will see this:

You have a choice at this point.  For a relative small number of images add them individually with the plus icon.  Right click on each and select deconvolution wizard.  It is generally safe to accept the default parameters suggested by the wizard.  I have only found it rare to need to overrule these preselected options.
