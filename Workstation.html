<p>This tutorial will take you through the basic steps of using the Huygens Deconvolution Wizard on the Linux Workstation in the RLEM (Scwitalla Room M102).</p>
<h2 id="login-at-the-rlem-workstation">Login at the RLEM Workstation</h2>
<p>User: scopeuser
Password:  please ask a staff member</p>
<h2 id="accessing-files-on-the-ftp-server">Accessing files on the FTP Server</h2>
<p>Files are stored on the FTP server for 7 days after upload.  Otherwise you will need to request that files be re-imported from AWS for use. </p>
<p>You can login by opening the link on the left hand side of the file manager window (to access open &quot;scopeuser&quot; folder on the desktop) called. &quot;FTP Server&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="open-huygens-professional">Open Huygens Professional</h2>
<p>Open SVI Huygens Professional by using the link on the Desktop. </p>
<p>The software will open to fill the screen and in the left center you will see this:</p>

<p>You have a choice at this point.  For a relative small number of images add them individually with the plus icon.  Right click on each and select deconvolution wizard.  It is generally safe to accept the default parameters suggested by the wizard.  I have only found it rare to need to overrule these preselected options.  Make sure you save each image afterward.  Tiff, OME-TIFF, and ICS2 are the best options.  You can also use Huygens Batch Processor to do lots of images.  </p>
<p>Huygens has many video tutorials available <a href="https://svi.nl/Webinars">here</a>.  Start with the first video on the deconvolution wizard and also the batch express video.  Please note the features that are present in our license include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Deconvolution for widefield and confocal</li>
<li>Visualization</li>
<li>Analysis</li>
</ol>
<p>So there is much material that will be applicable in these videos.  </p>
<p>In addition the latest user manual is present on the Desktop for viewing.</p>
<h2 id="saving-data">Saving data</h2>
<p>Data can be re-uploaded to the FTP server from the workstation machine after using Huygens.  Please delete all files that you downloaded to the workstation in preparation for the next user and to protect your data.  The data storage on the system will be automatically cleared every 30 days.  Please remember to logout of your session.</p>
